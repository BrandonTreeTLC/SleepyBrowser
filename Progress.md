12/10/24          Initialization, dreaming up, and adding initial features. ChatGPT Initial Compilation downloaded for edit preperation and designing. AI has had some serious problems trying to compile all the code all at 
                  once due to the fact of the maximum amount of allowed lines in ChatGPT. I also ran out of the 4.0 Model quickly, and I had to wait to get the best code I possibly could. The AI also mentioned that for me 
                  to do a splash screen in the beginning, I need to run  a program, followed by a 3 second pause, and then the browser, which would allow for smooth integration, inspired by Opera GX. Getting this to be a 
                  smooth transition while keeping the browser completly functional is VERY difficult, and during creation phase, I realized that the code with all the features I asked for was only 3kb in size, which is   
                  900 times smaller than the world record. If this actually works and functions properly, this is going to be absolutely horrifyingly the new world record for the smallest working fully featured browser in                   the  world. And even better so, absolutely zero tracking or tracing whatsoever. This can be so small, that at that size, you can almost have a browser anywhere that has a screen. I purposely made sure 
                  that it had zero capabilities to save  anything, and zero capabilities for history. This was an intentional feature. It would allow for true privacy, not this fake privacy all the other Browsers use, 
                  Firefox, Chrome, and Brave etc. are all saying they have "privacy and no trackability" which is completly false. Behold, a REAL private browser that is so minimal it is not even a feature that is 
                  considered, and all code is viewable, visual, and clear with it's intentions. No calling to random servers, no saving files, NO NOTHING. Just Browse, Turn Off, have fun. 


12/11/24          Did a complete computer reset and transfered the software required to bring this software to life. I am aware that the software is going to involve some serious UI Design, and adding the features going
                  to end up taking up some other space for adding those in. It may not be one of the world records after I am truly done, but it is cool to know that I can still make it over 800 times bigger and still be 
                  the record holder. I need to not let this get to my head. Setting the record is cool, but that is not my ultimate goal. My goal is to create the sleepiest browser ever. That focuses on sleep and that is
                  not a branch of Chrome, of Firefox, or whatever. I dont want it being like a remix of something already made. I want it to be it's own thing. I am stoked to start this project, and I am going to make
                  sure that I got everything set up to be able to do it, and hopfully will be able to make the project even better in the end. Then I will be able to get the website online, which honestly, looks 
                  absolutely stunning. I am going to put this up shortly, something tells me that this can actually become a real thing! No 200 files installation, no hiding a bunch of stuff, no VPN encryption bull.
                  Just. works. Just. works. Just. works.
