## How It Was Made

SleepyBrowser was originally made as a joke using AI trying to push it to it's limitations, however, it came together as a successful project! Crafted in visual basic, and incorporating gentle features to help encourage simplicity and sleep, it was later on compiled, and put through intense testing and modifications. Each line of code was checked, balanced, and soon, a browser the first of it's kind was born!

## What Makes Us Different
SleepyBrowser is crafted with sleep-encouraging features, and is a first of it's kind with a truly ZERO WEB TRACKING capability, clear and exposed code, and designed for Minimal Ram Requirements. Instead of encouraging you to sign in and give you 2000 settings, it places itself as simple, sleepy, and functional! The original code almost set a world record on being the smallest browser before full compile.
