<h1 align="center"> ABOUT ME </h1>

Hey everyone! My name is Brandon. I am a script kiddie just having a good time and learning about computer programming! I first got interested in computers back at my old elementry school, and as the years went on, I later on had a major surge of interest in middle school where I was enjoying the fun world of technology through a "Digimon" Phase. It became eventually where I took a class for computers, and was introduced to Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing! From there I started repairing computers, and eventually learning Linux with a neighbor!
